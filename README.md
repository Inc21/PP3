# Python Quiz Game.

This quiz is not like most quizzes out there, where you answer questions and by the end you get your score based on how many you got right or wrong. Basics of this game are simple. You get a question and four answers. Only one of the answer is correct. Where the "game" element comes in is when you answer that question. Answer correct and 10 points will be added to your account but answer incorrect and the game ends. Game records your name and score in database (Google sheet). Top 10 scores can be seen in High Scores section in main menu. Your goal is to get all 25 questions correct. Bonus will be added to your score and you can call yourself "Big deal in Python world"  

The game is Deployed on Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Live app can be found [here.](https://python-quiz-game-pp3.herokuapp.com/ "Python Quiz Game.")

# Design

## Look and feel

- As this game is developed with Python and designed to be run in the terminal, not to many design options available. Main emphasis in this app is readability. 

## Colour

To add a small bit of colour to text [Python colored](https://pypi.org/project/colored/ "Python colored.") module was used.

| Image | Color |
|---|---|
| ![dark_olive_green_2](/assets/images/dark_olive_green_2.png) | dark_olive_green_2 |
| ![light_red](/assets/images/light_red.png) | light_red |
| ![gold_3a](/assets/images/gold_3a.png) | gold_3a |
| ![light_yellow](/assets/images/light_yellow.png) | light_yellow |
| ![turquoise_2](/assets/images/turquoise_2.png) | turquoise_2 |

## Font

Arial is used for this app as per Code Institute template. Added custom ascii headers using [Python pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/ "Python pyfiglet.") module.

- The fallback font is cursive, sans-serif.

## Wireframe

### Wireframe for larger screens.

Created the original wireframe very early on in the development process. Later on and after talking and getting advice from my mentor I changed the design slightly from what was originally planned. I have decided to show and hide certain elements as needed. This makes the look and feel of the game not as distracting, much cleaner and more responsive whatever the screen size.
